# MarsBased 
### Basic development environment configuration
Script to install some of the tools we use at MarsBased, to install just copy paste
```
curl -L github.com/MarsBased/dev-config/raw/master/install.sh | sh
```
into your terminal.

The sublime package list and `~/.zshrc` will be renamed in case somebody had a previous version, but this script is mostly meant to be run on new computers.
